On Track:\n","The calculator monitors for shortfall and asset allocation deviation. On track suggests shortfall or\n","deviation, if any, is within 10% range. \n","\n","2. Needs Attention:\n","The calculator monitors for (a) projected shortfall and/or (b) asset allocation deviation in excess of\n","10%   of   suggested   allocation   over   4   weeks   consecutively.

The   investor   has   the   choice   to   proceed   with   recommendations,   partially   or   fully,   or\n","completely ignore them.

Hence, as the time horizon\n","for   a   SmartJar   increases,   the  equity   allocation   goes  up  and   vice  versa.
